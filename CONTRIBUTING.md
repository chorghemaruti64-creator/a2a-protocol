# Contributing to A2A Protocol\n\n## For Protocol Designers\n\n**If you want to propose changes to the A2A specification:**\n\n1. Read `/spec/A2A_PROTOCOL_v1.md` in detail\n2. Write an RFC (Request for Comments) as a pull request to `/spec`\n3. Include:\n   - Clear motivation\n   - Proposed changes (with examples)\n   - Impact analysis (backward compatibility, security, etc.)\n   - Implementation sketch\n4. Open issue for community discussion\n5. Merge after consensus\n\n**Note:** Specification changes require review from:\n- At least 2 core maintainers\n- Security reviewer for anything touching crypto/trust\n- Protocol engineers from the community\n\n## For Implementers\n\n**If you want to contribute to the reference implementation:**\n\n1. Pick an issue from the GitHub issue tracker\n2. Read the related spec section\n3. Follow the architecture in `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`\n4. Code style:\n   - Python 3.10+\n   - Type hints everywhere\n   - Docstrings for public APIs\n   - Tests for every feature\n5. Run tests: `make test`\n6. Submit PR with:\n   - Description of changes\n   - Links to related issues\n   - Test coverage\n\n## For Interoperability\n\n**If you're implementing A2A in another language:**\n\n1. Use the formal specification (`/spec/`)\n2. Run the protocol compliance test suite (when available)\n3. Write interop tests against the reference implementation\n4. Document your implementation\n5. Submit to the [A2A Ecosystem Registry](https://github.com/a2a-protocol/ecosystem)\n\n## Code Standards\n\n### Python\n\n```python\n# Type hints\ndef connect(remote_did: str, timeout: float = 30.0) -> Session:\n    \"\"\"Connect to remote agent.\\n    \n    Args:\n        remote_did: DID of remote agent\n        timeout: Connection timeout in seconds\n    \n    Returns:\n        Session: Authenticated session\n    \n    Raises:\n        UnverifiedAgentError: If agent cannot be verified\n        TimeoutError: If connection times out\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n# Error handling\ntry:\n    session = await agent.connect(did)\nexcept UnverifiedAgentError as e:\n    logger.error(f\"Agent verification failed: {e.message}\", extra={\"request_id\": e.request_id})\n    raise\nexcept TimeoutError as e:\n    if e.recoverable:\n        logger.warning(f\"Connection timeout, retrying...\")\n        return await retry_with_backoff(agent.connect, did)\n    else:\n        raise\n\n# Logging\nlogger.info(\n    \"handshake_complete\",\n    extra={\n        \"session_id\": session.id,\n        \"remote_agent_did\": session.remote_did,\n        \"duration_ms\": duration,\n    }\n)\n```\n\n### Commit Messages\n\n```\ntype: subject\n\nbody\n\nFooter\n\nTypes:\n- feat: new feature\n- fix: bug fix\n- docs: documentation\n- refactor: code restructuring\n- test: test additions/changes\n- spec: specification changes\n\nExample:\nfeat: implement DID resolution for did:web\n\nAdds support for resolving agent manifests via DNS-backed DIDs.\nIncludes manifest caching and signature verification.\n\nFixes #123\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n**Unit tests:**\n```bash\npytest tests/unit/\n```\n\n**Integration tests:**\n```bash\npytest tests/integration/\n```\n\n**Protocol compliance:**\n```bash\npytest tests/compliance/\n```\n\n**All tests:**\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\n## Security\n\nIf you find a security vulnerability:\n\n1. **Do NOT open a public issue**\n2. Email `security@a2a-protocol.org` with:\n   - Description of vulnerability\n   - Steps to reproduce\n   - Suggested fix (optional)\n3. We will:\n   - Acknowledge within 24 hours\n   - Work on fix in private\n   - Coordinate responsible disclosure\n   - Credit you in security advisory\n\n## Governance\n\n**Current Maintainers:**\n- @[architect] — Protocol design, specification\n- @[engineer1] — Reference implementation\n- @[security] — Security review\n\n**Decision Process:**\n- Specification changes: RFC + consensus from maintainers\n- Implementation changes: PR + code review + tests\n- New dependencies: Must be carefully reviewed for security/maintenance\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWe are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\n**Be respectful:**\n- Value diverse perspectives\n- Assume good intent\n- Provide constructive feedback\n- Accept criticism gracefully\n\n**No tolerance for:**\n- Harassment or discrimination\n- Hate speech\n- Threats\n- Personal attacks\n\n## Questions?\n\n- **Specification:** Open an issue in `/spec`\n- **Implementation:** Open an issue in `/reference`\n- **Security:** Email security@a2a-protocol.org\n- **General:** Open a discussion in GitHub Discussions\n\nThank you for contributing! 🚀\n"
